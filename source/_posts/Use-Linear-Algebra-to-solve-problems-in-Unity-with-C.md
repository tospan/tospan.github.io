1. 怎样知道敌人是在你前面还是后面？

2. If you are following a series of waypoints how do you know if you have passed a waypoint?

3. If you are steering towards a waypoint, how do you determine if you should steer left or right? You will also learn if you should turn left or right to reach a direction.

4. How can you find the coordinate where a ray intersects with a plane?

5. How can you tell if two line segments in 2D space intersect?

6. Are two triangles in 2D space intersecting?

7. Are two rectangles with orientation in 2D space intersecting?
