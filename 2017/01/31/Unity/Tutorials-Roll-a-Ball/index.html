        <p>We want to be able to pick up our collectable game objects when our player game object collides with them.<br>To do this we need to detect our collisions<br>between the player game object and the PickUp game objects.<br>We will need to have these collisions trigger a new behaviour and we will need to<br>test these collisions to make sure we are picking up the correct objects.<br>The PickUp objects, the player’s sphere, the ground plane and the walls all have colliders that inform us about collisions.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>If we didn’t test our collisions to find out which objects we have collided with we could collect the wrong objects.<br>We could collect the floor, or the walls.<br>As a matter of face if we didn’t test our collisions<br>on the very first frame of the game we would<br>come in contact with the ground plane<br>and we would collect the ground plane<br>and then we would fall in to the void of the scene space<br>and the game would essentially be over.<br>First, we don’t need our player to remain inactive.<br>so let’s tick the Active checkbox and<br>bring back our player.<br>Next let’s select the PlayerController script<br>and open it for editing.<br>Just a note, we could edit this<br>script regardless of whether the game<br>object is active or not.<br>Now that we have the script open,<br>what code are we going to write?<br>We could write collider<br>and then search the documentation using the<br>hot key combination.<br>But there is a different way that we could do this as well.<br>Let’s return to Unity and look at the details<br>of our player game object.<br>What we are interested in here is the<br>sphere collider component.<br>In the header of each component on the left<br>is the component’s turndown arrow,<br>the icon, the Enable checkbox<br>if it’s available, and the type of the component.<br>On the right is the context sensitive gear gizmo<br>and an icon of a little book with a question mark.<br>Now this is what we need.<br>This is the quick link to the component reference.<br>If we select this icon we are taken<br>not to the scripting reference but to the<br>component reference.<br>We would read this document to find out more<br>about how to use this component in the context<br>of the editor.<br>We, however, want to find out how to<br>script to this component’s class.<br>To do this we simply switch to scripting<br>and we are taken to the scripting reference<br>for the sphere collider.<br>We want to detect and test our collisions.<br>For this project we are going to use<br>OnTriggerEnter.<br>Just imagine if we were, say, a daring plumber<br>and we jumped up to collect a perfect arch of coins<br>and bounced off the very first one as we<br>collected it and fell back to the ground.<br>Not very elegant.<br>This code will give us the ability to detect<br>the contact between our player game object<br>and our PickUp game objects<br>without actually creating a physical collision.<br>The code example however is not exactly<br>what we’re looking for.<br>But that’s okay, we can change that.<br>First, let’s copy the code,<br>and then let’s return to our scripting application.<br>Now that we’re back in scripting let’s paste the code.<br>As we have copied this code from a webpage<br>let’s correct the indents.<br>In this case I’m going to make sure the<br>indents are tabs and that all of the tabs are<br>correctly aligned.<br>Next, let’s look at this code.<br>We are using the function OnTriggerEnter.<br>OnTriggerEnter will be called by Unity<br>when our player game object first touches<br>a trigger collider.<br>We are given as an argument<br>a reference to the trigger collider that we have touched.<br>This is the collider called Other.<br>This reference gives us a way to get a<br>hold of the colliders that we touch.<br>With this code, when we touch another trigger<br>collider we will destroy the game object<br>that the trigger collider is attached to<br>through the reference other.gameObject.<br>By destroying that game object, the game object,<br>all of it’s components and all of it’s<br>children and their components are removed<br>from the scene.<br>For the sake of example in this assignment<br>we won’t destroy the other game object<br>we will deactivate it.<br>Just like we deactivated the player object<br>when we were creating our PickUp objects.<br>First, let’s remove the Destroy(other.gameobject)<br>code from the function.<br>But let’s paste it down below our script<br>as a palette to work with.<br>How will we deactivate our PickUp objects?<br>Well what clues do we have?<br>We can address the other collider’s game<br>object through other.gameObject.<br>We can see this here in the sample code.<br>And we want to test the other game object<br>and if it’s a PickUp object we want to deactivate<br>that game object.<br>So let’s look up GameObject<br>with our hot key combination and see what we can find.<br>Now we have the page on GameObject.<br>There are two important items here that we want.<br>They are tag,<br>tag allows us to identify the game object<br>by comparing the tag value to a string.<br>And SetActive.<br>This is how we activate or deactivate a game object through code.<br>The last item we need to know about is<br>Compare Tag.<br>Compare Tag allows us to efficiently<br>compare the tag of any game object to a sting value.<br>Let’s open up these three items, each in their own tab.<br>Tag allows us to identify a game object by a tag value.<br>We must declare our tags in the Tags and Layers Panel before using them.<br>It is possible to test a tag against a string value directly<br>with code like<br>if gameObject.tag is the same as some string value.<br>But there is a more efficient built-in way to do this,<br>and that is CompareTag<br>With CompareTag we can efficiently<br>compare the tag of any game object with a string value.<br>Let’s copy the sample code and<br>paste it in to our working palette.<br>Now GameObject.SetActive.<br>This is how we activate or deactivate a game object.<br>This is the code equivalent of clicking<br>the Active check box next to the<br>Name field in the Inspector.<br>In our case, just like the code snippet,<br>we will call GameObject.SetActive (false)<br>to deactivate our PickUp game objects.<br>Let’s copy this code and returning to our script editor<br>paste it in to our palette as well.<br>I feel we have enough pieces to write our code<br>so let’s write if (other.gameObject.CompareTag<br>with the string value of PickUp<br>and we will have to define this tag in Unity later.<br>other.gameObject.SetActive (false);<br>Now this code will be called every time<br>we touch a trigger collider.<br>We are given a reference to the collider we touch,<br>we test it’s tag,<br>and if the tag is the same as the string value<br>PickUp we will take the other game object<br>and we will call SetActive (false),<br>which will deactivate that game object.<br>Now we don’t need this code we’ve been saving anymore<br>and keeping it will only confuse the compiler<br>so we can delete it.<br>Let’s save this script and return to Unity<br>and check for errors.<br>The first thing we need to do it set up the tag value<br>for the PickUp objects.<br>Select the prefab asset for the PickUp object.<br>When we look at the tag list<br>we don’t see any tag called PickUp<br>so we need to add one.<br>Select Add Tag.<br>This brings up the Tags and Layers Panel.<br>Here we can customise tags and layers.<br>Note that this list is empty.<br>To create a new custom tag select the + button<br>to add a new row to the tags list.<br>In the new empty element, in our case tag 0,<br>type PickUp, and this is case sensitive<br>and needs to be exactly the same string<br>that we have in our script.<br>If in doubt we can copy and paste<br>this string to get the exact value.<br>When we look back at the prefab asset<br>note that the asset is still untagged.<br>By selecting Add Tag we changed our focus<br>from the prefab asset to the Tag Manager<br>and in the Tag Manager we created our tag.<br>Now we need to apply that tag<br>to the prefab asset.<br>Select the Tag drop down again<br>and see how we now have PickUp in the list.<br>Select this tag from the list and the asset<br>is now tagged PickUp.<br>And with the power of prefabs<br>all of the instances are now tagged PickUp as well.<br>Now let’s test our game.<br>Save the scene and enter play mode.<br>Hmm, okay, our tag is set to PickUp<br>but we are still bouncing off the PickUp cubes<br>just like we are bouncing off the walls.<br>So let’s exit play mode.<br>Before we discuss why we are bouncing off<br>the PickUp cubes rather than picking them up<br>we need to have a brief discussion about<br>Unity’s physics system.<br>I’m going to enter play mode for this discussion.<br>Let’s look at one of our cubes and our player.<br>As an aside we can select two or<br>more game objects at the same time<br>and inspect them all.<br>We do this by holding down the command key<br>on the mac or the control key on the PC,<br>and selecting the game objects.<br>When we select multiple game objects<br>note how the inspector changes to show<br>the common components and property<br>values of the selected game objects.<br>The inspector also allows for multi-object editing.<br>Using multi-object editing I’m going to<br>disable the mesh renderer on both the<br>player’s sphere and the selected cube with a single click.<br>This leaves us with the two green outlines<br>of the collider volumes for these two objects.<br>How do collisions work in Unity’s physics engine?<br>The physics engine does not allow two collider<br>volumes to overlap.<br>When the physics engine detects that any two<br>or more colliders will overlap that frame<br>the physics engine will look at the objects and<br>analyse their speed and rotation and shape<br>and calculate a collision.<br>One of the major factors in this calculation<br>is whether the colliders are static<br>or dynamic.<br>Static colliders are usually non-moving<br>parts of your scene, like the walls, the floor,<br>or the fountain in the courtyard.<br>Dynamic colliders are things that move<br>like the player’s sphere or a car.<br>When calculating a collision the static geometry<br>will not be affected by the collision.<br>But the dynamic objects will be.<br>In our case the player’s sphere is dynamic,<br>or moving geometry, and it is bouncing<br>off the static geometry of the cubes.<br>Just as it bounces off the static geometry<br>of the walls.<br>The physics engine can however allow the<br>penetration or overlap of collider volumes.<br>When it does this the physics engine<br>still calculates the collider volumes and<br>keeps track of the collider overlap.<br>But it doesn’t physically act on the overlapping<br>objects, it doesn’t cause a collision.<br>We do this by making our colliders in to<br>triggers, or trigger colliders.<br>When we make our colliders in to a trigger,<br>or trigger collider, we can detect<br>the contact with that trigger through the<br>OnTrigger event messages.<br>When a collider is a trigger you can do<br>clever things like place a trigger in the middle<br>of a doorway in, say, an adventure game,<br>and when the player enters the trigger<br>the mini-map updates and a message plays<br>‘you have discovered this room’.<br>Or every time your player walks around<br>that corner spiders drop from the ceiling<br>because the player has walked through a trigger.<br>For more information on OnCollision and on<br>trigger messages see the lessons linked below.<br>We are using OnTriggerEnter in our code<br>rather than OnCollisionEnter.<br>So we need to change our collider volumes<br>in to trigger volumes.<br>To do this we must be out of play mode.<br>Let’s select the prefab asset and look at<br>the box collider component.<br>Here we select Is Trigger<br>and again the power of prefabs<br>all of our PickUp objects are now using trigger colliders.<br>Let’s save our scene, enter play mode and test.<br>And as our player enters the trigger<br>we pickup the objects.<br>Excellent.<br>Let’s exit play mode.<br>Everything looks great.<br>We only have one issue.<br>We have made one small mistake,<br>and this is related to how Unity<br>optimises it’s physics.<br>As a performance optimisation Unity<br>calculates all the volumes<br>of all the static colliders in a scene<br>and holds this information in a cache.<br>This makes sense as static colliders<br>shouldn’t move, and this saves recalculating this<br>information every frame.<br>Where we have made our mistake is by rotating our cubes.<br>Any time we move, rotate, or scale a static collider<br>Unity will recalculate all the static colliders again<br>and update the static collider cache.<br>To recalculate the cache takes resources.<br>We can move, rotate or scale dynamic<br>colliders as often as we want and Unity won’t<br>recache any collider volumes.<br>Unity expects us to move colliders.<br>We simply need to indicate to Unity which<br>colliders are dynamic before we move them.<br>We do this by using the rigid body component.<br>Any game object with a collider<br>and a rigid body is considered dynamic.<br>Any game object with a collider attached<br>but no physics rigid body is expected to be static.<br>Currently our PickUp game objects have a<br>box collider but no rigid body.<br>So Unity is recalculating our static<br>collider cache every frame.<br>The solution is to add a rigid body<br>to the PickUp objects.<br>This will move the cubes from being static colliders<br>to being dynamic colliders.<br>Let’s save and play.<br>And our cubes fall through the floor.<br>Gravity pulls them down, and as they are triggers<br>they don’t collide with the floor.<br>Let’s exit play mode.<br>If we look at the rigid body component<br>we could simply disable Use Gravity,<br>which would prevent the cubes from being pulled downwards.<br>This is only a partial solution however.<br>If we did this, even though our cubes<br>would not respond to gravity they would still<br>respond to physics forces<br>There is a better solution.<br>And that is to select Is Kinematic.<br>When we do this we set this rigid body component to be<br>a kinematic rigid body.<br>A kinematic rigid body will not react<br>to physics forces and it can be animated<br>and moved by it’s transform.<br>This is great for everything from objects with colliders<br>like elevators and moving platforms,<br>to objects with triggers, like our collectables<br>that need to be animated or moved by their transform.<br>For more information on the rigid body<br>and Is Kinematic see the lessons linked below.<br>Let’s save our scene and enter play mode to test.<br>Now our behaviour is identical and performant.<br>So, static colliders shouldn’t move,<br>like walls and floors.<br>Dynamic colliders can move,<br>and have a rigid body attached.<br>Standard rigid bodies are moved using physics forces.<br>Kinematic rigid bodies are moved using<br>their transform.</p>
<p>In the next assignment we will count our collectable object and make a simple UI to display our score and messages.</p>
